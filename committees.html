			 <br>SIZE: 40-45 members and provisional members</br>

             <br>DIRECTORS: Amudhini RA, Vartika Neeraj</br>

The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes 

recommendations about the global financial system. It was established after the 2009 G-20 

London summit in April 2009 as a successor to the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). The Board 

includes all G-20 major economies, FSF members, and the European Commission. It is based in 

Basel, Switzerland.

<br>The FSB being stimulated at SANSKRITI MUN’2016 would be the perfect nexus of technical 

knowledge, nimbleness, and analytical skills. The agendas being stimulated pertain to current 

issues that are of utmost global importance and have a severe debilitating effect on the 

economies of all the member states.</br> 

<br>1. Transforming Shadow Banking into resilient market-based finance: Shadow Banking System' 

refers to the financial intermediaries involved in facilitating the creation of credit across the 

global financial system, but whose members are not subject to regulatory oversight. The 

shadow banking system also refers to unregulated activities by regulated institutions. The 

committee would discuss matters like the persisting detrimental effects of shadow banking and 

how it impacted the financial crisis (2007-12),strengthening the oversight and regulation of 

shadow banking, effectiveness of previous policies and propose new policies for tackling the 

problems arisen by shadow banking.</br>

<br>2. Regulating the Impact of Economic Warfare on Developing Countries: Economic warfare 

includes the ability to exert influence in the way of another nation’s global stance with respect 

to reducing its military power and political stability by the usage of economic mediums. It 

includes sanctions, embargoes, restriction of capital inflow, change in tariff rates etc. Being 

viewed as an alternative to military usage it has severe economic impacts on all nations 

especially those which do not have a stable and growing economy. With sanctions on Iran 

crippling the nation’s oil dependant economy and the Russian rubles daily fluctuations, 

economic warfare has become the weapon of selection and in today’s time it is imperative to 

discuss this issue on a global platform. This committee would act as a rostrum for the regulation 

of the same paving way to the construction of comprehensive international dictum for the 

establishment of a substantial law to rule such fundamental economics of supply and demand.</br></font></p>

<br>DIRECTORS: Subhashini Krishna, Vanessa Singh</br>
<br>Agenda- Review of the intelligence agencies and their policies in light of the recent Pathankot attacks</br>

<br>Terrorism caused by 6 terrorists for 80 hours. This is the recent story of our city- Pathankot, Punjab.</br> 

<br>On 2nd January 2016 when the natives couldn’t even finish with the New Year celebrations, they were stormed by the horrifying news of a terror attack.

Soldiers martyred but in the end all 6 were neutralized.

But who’s the culprit here?</br>
 
<br>The Indian intelligence consists of 12 basic bodies looking into different areas of specialisation, something that could have been an effective system but isn't.

Throughout history there have been hundreds of recorded blunders by the Indian intelligence caused by something as small as a communication problem.</br>

<br>Delegates, in this committee you will be required to go deep into workings of Indian intelligence and discuss everything that went wrong the hows' and the whys' and the what ifs'. </br>

<br>We can not afford another Pathankot, time is running out.</br> 

<br>Jai Hind. </br><br>Jai Jawaan.</br>

			<p><font face="nexa"> <h2> THE MUGHAL COURT OF 1615 </h2>
			<BR><H3>SPECIALIZED</H3></BR>
			<br>DIRECTORS:Jailekha Zutshi, Apoorv Pandey</br>
			<br>Committee Size: 15-20</br>

<br>The year is 1615. The place is Agra, North India.</br>

<br>In recent years, the Mughal Empire has grown in size and power under Jahangir and his predecessor 

Akbar. Yet, despite its seemingly formidable exterior, the ill effects of rapid expansion are starting 

to show.

Rogue provinces such as Mewar may finally be capitulating, but the details of their currently 

dubious alliance still have to be cemeneted. Meanwhile, Sir Thomas Roe, the ambassador of the 

court of King James I of England to Jahangir’s court, has finally arrived at Agra, creating a stir both 

within the Emperor’s retinue and between the Jesuit priests from Portugal present in court. While 

Roe’s mission lies in ensuring protection for the East India Company’s factory in Surat, he seems 

adamant on becoming a favourite of the Emperor, much to the chagrin of the latter’s family.</br>

<br>Meanwhile, within the borders of the empire, a plethora of problems merits urgent attention. 

Though Khusrau, Jahangir’s eldest son, was blinded after a failed attempt to seize power in 1607; 

Prince Khurram, the third eldest of the emperors sons, has maintained a cool distance since Jahangir 

married Nur Jahan in 1611. Malik Ambar, a rebel leading the Deccan against the might of the 

Empire, has lain low for a time, but may strike at any time, making the status of recent victories in 

the area uncertain. Moreover, a defining battle with the empire’s long-time enemy the Raja of 

Kangra is imminent, as is guerilla warfare with the Ahoms of Burma. In addition, expanding the 

empire and simultaneously appeasing a large and diverse population remain important concerns.</br>
<br>The future of the Mughal Empire lies in your hands. Together, attacks must be planned, traitors 

must be punished and alliances must be forged if the Empire is to retain its glory.</br></font></p>

			<BR><BR><h2> JOINT CRISIS COMMITTEE </h2></BR></BR>
			<BR><H3>CRISIS</H3></BR>
			<BR>Agenda: Korean War, 1950</BR>
			<BR>Size: 12-15 per cabinet</BR>
			<BR>DIRECTORS: Suryaansh Nath Bhaduri (Syngman Rhee) and Saatvik Jha (Kim Il Sung)
</BR>
			
			<BR>A hallmark of Sanskriti MUN, the JCC at SMUN 2016 will be simulating the Korean War. A conflict wrought in the wake of the 2nd World War, the Korean War was the first in a bloody series which comprised the Cold War. Encompassing the length and breadth of the ideological divide between communism and capitalism, the Korean War yielded a stalemate which reflected the zeitgeist of its age. The conflict on the Korean Peninsula drew in parties from all over the globe, setting the tone for the remainder of the century.
</BR>
			<BR>The most interesting aspect of this conflict is the pivotal role played by external entities. It could be said that the Korean War was decided by all but the Koreans themselves. Potential delegates find themselves at the summation of a 5 year period of rising tensions between the two Koreas, the peninsula having been split in half between the Soviet and American forces at the conclusion of WW2. The North, led by Kim Il-Sung and backed by the USSR, threaten to shatter the delicate peace that has been holding the continent from erupting into chaos. Meanwhile the South, spearheaded by Syngman Rhee and sponsored by the USA, looks to turn to the United Nations Security Council for aid in the event of a breach of sovereignty. With tension high in the atmosphere, the region is poised for a bloodbath. The onus is on the delegates to relive this portentous time and manoeuvre the chessboard that is the field of international diplomacy in order to avoid the mistakes made by their predecessors in the recent past.</BR>
			<BR>Godspeed, delegates.
<BR>Live Long and Prosper</BR>

			<BR><h2>UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL</h2></BR></BR>
			<BR><H3>CRISIS</H3></BR>
			<BR>DIRECTORS: Trisha Sobti, Soham Dalwani</BR>
			<BR>SIZE: 20-25</BR>
			<BR>AGENDA: OPEN AGENDA</BR>
			<BR>“Think before you act, don’t act before you think. Therein lies 

the secret to victory”</BR>
			<BR>The United Nations Security Council is one of the 6 principal organs of the United 

Nations and undoubtedly the most powerful. With its primary duty being the 

maintenance of international peace and security, the UNSC has a vast mandate, 

encompassing a number of responsibilities. Conceived like a phoenix from the 

ashes of the Second World War, the UNSC carries out this gargantuan duty 

through measures proposed by its 15 members, ranging from binding resolutions to 

mediating dispute settlements.</BR>
			
		<BR>“When diplomacy ends, War begins.”</BR>
		<BR>Now, the Security Council enters perhaps one of its most perilous times, the year 

2012. From the Iranian oil embargo to unprecedented North Korean aggression, 

2012 is etched in history as a year rife with conflict – a year that forever altered the 

face of the global community and reshaped the geopolitical landscape.

This year’s Security Council at Sanskriti Model United Nations will be simulating 

the proceedings of the Security Council through the year 2012.

The freeze date for committee will be January 1st, 2012. All subsequent updates will 

be at various points during the year.</BR></font></p>

		<br><h2>INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS</h2></br>
		<br>SIZE:50</br>
		<br>AGENDA:ILLEGAL MIGRATION AND DRUG TRAFFIKING</br>
		<br>“One of the critical issues that we have to confront is illegal immigration, because this is a multi-

headed Hydra that affects our economy, our health care, our education systems, our national 

security, and also our local criminality.”

-Allen West</br>
		<br>“We cannot continue doing the same thing and expect different results” 

– Otto Pérez Molina, President of Guatemala on the War on Drugs</br>
		<br>Illegal Migration and Drug Trafficking have been contentious issues in the North and South 

American states for years. Drug Trafficking is one of the most lucrative businesses in Mexico, 

United States of America and Colombia due to the convenient location of the countries. Illegal 

Migration to the United States has been one of the highly debated topics for the US Presidential 

Elections in 2016.</br>
		<br>According to Amnesty International, workers crossing the border into America are routinely 

kidnapped, raped, and murdered by local gangs. The authorities respond by doing nothing. By 

Amnesty’s estimates, this indifference results in tens of thousands of deaths and assaults every 

year. Migrants from Mexico face the remote wastes of the burning Arizona desert—an area 

known as the Corridor of Death. Since 2001, this stretch of wilderness has killed 2,100 people. 

But in the last four years, the body count has really taken off, soaring to dizzying new highs.</br>
		<br>The Mexican Drug War and the cartels involved have been known to have taken away almost 

50,000 lives in the past six years. Children have been employed in hazardous situations and are 

denied basic rights and freedoms, the mental and physical health of the workers are being 

affected and the country’s resources are being drained. This committee should hope to end the 

war against the drug cartels in victory, which the Latin American Commission on Drugs and 

Democracy had declared a “failure” in 2009.</br>
		<br>The mandate of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights allows the analysis and 

investigation of individual petitions by the public in which violations of human rights are alleged 

to have been committed by one of the countries present in the committee. Moreover, the 

Commission could hold a temporary session of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights when 

two countries or blocs instigate a challenge against each other when they have different 

viewpoints, in which the Chair will have the final say in the ruling.</br>
		<br>It must also be noted here that this stimulation of IACHR will not stick merely to the agenda of 

illegal migration and drug trafficking, but will delve into other humanitarian issues in the Inter- 

American continent, such as the Civil War in Columbia and its consequences on basic human 

rights, the rising starvation rates in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras due to 

drought, sex trafficking in Mexico, the reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity in 

Guatemala, the plight of the internally displaced Native Tribes across the continent and so 

forth, all of which shall be mentioned in the background guide, and may be introduced as a 

crises.</br></font></p>

			<BR><h2>THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS</h2></BR>
			<BR>EDITORIN-IN-CHIEF:Prat Parhi</BR>
			<BR>EDITORS:Srishti Mittal,Avikant Bhan,Bikramjit Sarcar
			<BR>Greetings Delegates,
			<BR>Welcome to the International Press. In this committee, delegates don’t represent nations but agencies 

as they take on the mantle of journalists. As journalists you will actualize the simulation known as 

Model United Nations by writing and making delegates accountable and susceptible to critique. 

Journalism serves the purpose of conveying news to the world. Yet it transcends mere documentation 

and distribution of events. Press creates a forum for individuals to assess policies, reforms and events 

and highlight global repercussions and overlooked facets of committee proceedings. Here, delegates 

have the opportunity to uncover latent realities to the world and bring to the public eye what they 

think is important.</BR>
			<BR>For Sanskriti MUN 2016, delegates of the International Press will be representing individual agencies. 

Journalists will have to write articles covering committee proceedings, not only conveying what 

happened but also analyzing policy decisions. They will also conduct interviews, send in timely 

updates, and conduct press conferences. Delegates of the International Press will also be working 

under deadlines to submit quality pieces. They will be judged for awards on the basis of the quality of 

their write-ups, their skills in work-management and their adherence to their agency policies.</BR>
			<BR>Furthermore, journalists will also have the freedom to explore more creative forms of writing for the 

SMUN Press blog. Here journalists may access the freedom to write humorous pieces, casual 

interviews or cover anything related to the MUN. Their oratory skills will also be tested during Press 

Conferences. Analytical Pieces will give journalists the opportunity to publicize their own biases free 

from agency restrictions, albeit in a diplomatic and logical fashion.</BR>
			<BR>In its essence, the International Press shoulders the task of capturing the essence of the conference. 

When the committees and their agendas have elapsed, it is your words, journalists, which engrave 

them in remembrance. Unfading will be your ideas, your thoughts, your very perception of 

proceedings that altogether encase the conference. One must centralise diplomacy and impartiality in 

one’s writings. For the erudite words of the Press are meant to outshine and outlive the views of the 

rest.</BR></font></p>

			<br>DIRECTORS:Anindini Singh, Isha Ahlawat</br>
			<br>SIZE:40-50</br>
			<br>A ‘Cauldron of Intractable Conflicts within Intractable Conflicts’, the Middle East and North African region is home to twenty nine countries, three of humanity’s greatest religions, the Hindu- Arabic numeral system and some of the world’s longest wars and fiercest ideological battles. 

</br>
			<br>After the fall of the Ottoman Empire post World War one and the emergence of independent states and a new world order, several problems arose within the region as states grappled with poor domestic governance, territorial disputes, rise of extremism and excessive western interference. Ranging from hostility between Israel and Palestine, to distrust between Turkey and Kurdistan, to the enmity between Sunnis and Shiites, historical perceptions have moulded modern day attitudes and age old hatred has forced its way well into the 21st century. However, with the UN lifting its sanctions on Iran, pro- democracy protests across the Arab World, rise of daesh, Kurdish insurgency, fresh conflicts between Israel and Palestine and the unprecedented refugee crisis, the balance of power in the region is fast changing. As conflicts have intensified, their tremors have not failed to wreak havoc throughout MENA, leaving its landscape forever changing and the trajectory of its future events, difficult to speculate.
</br>
			<br>Keeping this in mind, we welcome you to the seventieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Set in the future, the committee will convene on December 31st, 2017 when delegates will attempt to assuage the many conflicting issues that arise in the Arab World along with finding common ground on issues that have been hotly debated upon for decades to surmounting problems, faced never before by humanity.

			<br>DIRECEOTRS: Malhar Mishra, Yashovardhan Pandey</br>
			<br>SIZE:20-25</br>
			<br>Special Summit on ISIS- 2017</br>
			<br>The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS or ISIL) has been growing for the past few years and today, in 2017, its threat to the world is most imminent. </br>
			<br>Asian superpowers face a bigger risk than ever before in this respect, with the ISIS creating a huge impact on the welfare of the lives of citizens in this region. ISIS aims to gain religious, political, and military control over the entire Islamic community and eventually, the world. It has once again shown the extent they are willing to go to achieve their goal once again, as is clear with the recent organisation of coordinated terror attacks in Russia, China and India. Attacks during a T20 match in Wankhade Stadium ( 21st August2016,Mumbai, India), the Bank of China Tower (15th September,Hong Kong, China) and The Cathedral of St. Sophia (1st November,Veliky Novgorod, Russia) clearly highlight their ruthless and depraved nature and their unrelenting will. Realising the extent of the power ISIS wields, Ban ki-Moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, has called for a Special Summit on ISIS to be held in January 2017.
			<br>Welcome to the Special Summit on ISIS delegates, the responsibility of combating one of the most powerful enemies of today’s world, is now in your hands.</br>
			<br>The Special Summit on ISIS has representatives from around the world and the committee will be semi-crisis</br></br>
